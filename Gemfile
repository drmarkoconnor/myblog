# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
#
# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.
# Happy Jekylling!
