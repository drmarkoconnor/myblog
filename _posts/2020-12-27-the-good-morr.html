<h1>The Good-Morrow</h1>

<h3>by john donne</h3>

<p>This doesn’t render nicely as the tbx note exports as html and not md ( because author page insert doesn’t work if not ) So use Drafts app to convert text like this into html and use that in tbx which markup and quote html option checked</p>

<h1>I wonder, by my troth, what thou and I</h1>

<p>Did, till we loved? Were we not weaned till then? 
But sucked on country pleasures, childishly? 
Or snorted we in the Seven Sleepers’ den? 
’Twas so; but this, all pleasures fancies be. 
If ever any beauty I did see, 
Which I desired, and got, ’twas but a dream of thee. </p>

<h1>And now good-morrow to our waking souls,</h1>

<p>Which watch not one another out of fear; 
For love, all love of other sights controls, 
And makes one little room an everywhere. 
Let sea-discoverers to new worlds have gone, 
Let maps to other, worlds on worlds have shown, 
Let us possess one world, each hath one, and is one. </p>

<h1>My face in thine eye, thine in mine appears,</h1>

<p>And true plain hearts do in the faces rest; 
Where can we find two better hemispheres, 
Without sharp north, without declining west? 
Whatever dies, was not mixed equally; 
If our two loves be one, or, thou and I 
Love so alike, that none do slacken, none can die.</p>
