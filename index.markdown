## This is a play area to test out and learn Jekyll

It has a few dummy-ish posts and gem theme files ( \_layout, \_includes etc... have been brought into the local folder and config.yml and gemfile files have been modified to make this a 'regular' theme)

Nothing to see here and site will change/morph/break and deprecate soon
